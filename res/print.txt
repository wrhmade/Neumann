        My teacher, Miss Wang, helped me a lot in my middle school life. She is a kind easygoing woman. I must thank her for making a confident girl.
        I used to be a shy and unconfident girl. Mrs. Wang noticed me. She took good care of me and encouraged me to join the school speech contest. Of course, I failed. But Mrs. Wang cheered me up and said every man is the architect of his own future.
        From then on, I practiced every day. It goes without saying ¡°No pain, no gain.¡± I won the contest in the second term. In my opinion, teachers are the same as gardeners and they volunteer today and gain tomorrow. Not only can they teach knowledge but also they can teach students how to be a successful man.
        Thank you, Mrs. Wang. You make a duck become a beautiful swan. I want to be a teacher that as same as you in the future.
